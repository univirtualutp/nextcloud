Concepts

API Access Control Mechanism
----------------------------

Each application defines list of API groups it intends to access.

This system easily allows you to increase the level of trust in applications.
Even prior to installation, it's possible to ascertain the API groups to which an application will gain access.

Extensible Deployment
---------------------

The system should support the expansion and integration of new deployment methods, avoiding any tight coupling with a specific deployment type.
Applications should be capable of indicating the deployment methods they can accommodate.

Given the evolving landscape of new technologies and the potential emergence of more intricate or simplified deployment options,
the system is architected to seamlessly embrace the integration of novel deployment modes.
